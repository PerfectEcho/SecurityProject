This is a proof of concept demonstrating a recent exploit on the IOS platform, that when a malformed message is sent it will brick devices that utilize IMessage. This malformed message contains a type that isn't an NSString and in this event it throws an exception which continually crashes the SpringBoard on the device. SpringBoard is the application responsible for the homescreen on the device and with this repeatedly crashing it renders the device useless. I would like to demonstrate this concept by setting up a website using python and flask plus it will be utilizing json to encode and decode the input. This website will accept input from the user with the goal of giving unexpected input that the server will attempt to decode and improperly handle the exception causing repeated crashes of the server.
